## üí° Tips

### Recommended Logo Specs
- **Format:** PNG (with transparent background preferred)
- **Size:** At least 400x400 pixels for crisp display
- **Aspect Ratio:** Square (1:1) works best
- **File Size:** Keep under 500KB for fast loading

### Alternative Formats
If you want to use a different format:
- JPG/JPEG (no transparency)
- WebP (better compression, modern browsers)
- SVG (vector, best quality at any size)

If using a different format, update the file extension in:
`app/page.tsx` line 56:
```typescript
src="/seeta-league-logo.png"  // Change .png to your format
```
